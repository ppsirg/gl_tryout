Suppose that you have 5 Python projects which you’re working on and each of them have
their own dependencies (libraries). These projects have common dependencies but different
versions of the same dependencies.


Functionality:
- How could you handle this case? How would you solve it?
    - answer: using virtual environments with virtualenv or virtualenvwrapper, one virtualenv for every project
- If you imported objects from some module, will the requested objects be loaded only?
or will all the objects and definitions be loaded?. Explain.
    - answer: it will be loaded the imported object and all its dependencies and definitions, but only the imported object will be accessible directly
- If you imported objects from a module, would the lines code outside of functions and
classes be executed?
    - answer: it will not be executed, except for the dependencies of imported code, the module will be read and parsed but not executed
- What is the purpose of “if __name__ == __main__” in the bottom part of any module?
When will it be executed?
    - answer: its purpose is to define the things that will be executed when the .py file is run directly (python module.py) and avoid execution when it is used indirectly by imports from other files
